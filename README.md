beginning foray into the tech world after ignoring it for 30+ years
An information professional with more than 20 years in a consultancy, I'm now returning to the world of technology that I thought I'd left behind as an undergrad. The punchcards were on their way out as I finished my bachelor's, and the PC was only a few years from hitting everyone's desks. By the late 80s I was in love with technology again, and a few guys like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made computing easier. Much easier.
